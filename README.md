# Wallpapers

This is my personal wallpaper collection, arranged by category to make it easy to explore and access. Each category is structured to simplify browsing and help you quickly find wallpapers that suit your preferences.

Mywallpapers come from [Wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc/), [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn/) or other places and repositories on the internet.

## Installation

To grab these wallpapers for yourself, run:
```
cd ~/your-wallpaper-directory/
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ollieistic/wallpapers.git
rm -f README.md
```

Using `--depth 1` tells Git to only pull the latest commit, instead of the entire commit history, which saves some disk space.

## Updating

Download the latest wallpapers from this repository by running the commands below:
```
cd ~/your-wallpaper-directory/
git pull
```

## Disclaimer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This collection does not include any wallpapers that I personally own.
> All images are sourced from third parties and are provided here purely for convenient access.
> Unfortunately, I am unable to provide attribution or credit for each image, as doing so would require an unreasonable amount of time.
